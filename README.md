# FAQ
## What is the difference between the master and release branches?
There are two types of NuGet packages that get built from the code in this repository:
* __Pre-release packages__: the pre-release packages are built after every change on the master branch
* __Release packages__: after a period of time when more changes are made to master, the Team creates release packages which are published to NuGet.org.
The release packages are built from the master branch. Public contributions are accepted only from the master branch.

## Where are the NuGet packages for the components in this repository available for download?
The pre-release NuGet packages which are built from the master branch are available to download from the MyGet feed

    https://www.myget.org/F/omex/api/v3/index.json


Soon, the release packages will be available for download from NuGet.org.
