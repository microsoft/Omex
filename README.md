# FAQ
## What is the difference between the main and release branches?
There are two types of NuGet packages that get built from the code in this repository:
* __Pre-release packages__: the pre-release packages are built after every change on the main branch
* __Release packages__: after a period of time when more changes are made to main, the Team creates release packages which are published to NuGet.org.
The release packages are built from the main branch. Public contributions are accepted only from the main branch.
