# Microsoft Omex Document Db library.
(c) Microsoft Corporation.

This library contains wrapper APIs over Microsoft Azure Document Db .Net Client SDK. Current library provides helper methods on:
- Settings / Configuration
- Databases
- Collections
- Documents
- Server Side Scripts: Stored Procedures, Triggers
- Sample Stored Procedure and Trigger implementations in JScript

The library also exposes native [IDocumentClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.idocumentclient?view=azure-dotnet) interface from the SDK, 
so users are not limited to the functionality exposed from the library and can still leverage the full functionality of the Azure Document Db Client SDK directly.
